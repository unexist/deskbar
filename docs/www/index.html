			<h3>What is deskbar?</h3>
			<p>
				Deskbar is a lightweight system monitor without large dependancies to
				other libraries or toolkits. It's completely build on top of the Xlib.
				The output will be written directly to the root window, so the placing
				and all other configuration is done via a XML based configuration file.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the moment there's only the display of text possibly, support for PNG 
				is planned but not implemented yet. This will be optional and may be 
				excluded at compile time.
			</p>

			<h3>What does it do?</h3>
			<p>
				Deskbar is pluggable, so it's features depend on the loaded plugins. 
				Without any <a class="inline" href="">plugins</a> there isn't much to
				tell about. The reason for this behaviour is easy: The aim is to be as
				lightweight as possible, so e.g. if you don't need a 
				<a class="inline" href="">clock</a> why should we load/run the update
				code for it?
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently it consists of the main application, a library and a config
				script to build plugins outside of the tree and of course some basic 
				<a class="inline" href="">plugins</a>. (More will follow)

				<h4>Smart Iterations</h4>
				<p>
					Whenever a plugin is loaded, an interval time for the update cycle of the
					plugin is required. It's possibly to set it in the config file or to use the
					default time. After the loading of every plugin is completed, the interval
					time of the main cycle will be computed. The main loop cycles in the calculated
					time.
				</p>

				<h4>Exception Handling</h4>
				<p>
					A common problem with plugin based monitors is the reliability of these plugins.
					Normally, whenever a plugin 'misbehaves' the whole program dies. Deskbar catches
					the segmentation fault and ejects the plugin. Allocated memory will be free'd, if
					the alloc functions of the <a class="inline" href="">API</a> are used.
				</p>

				<h4>Garbage Collection</h4>
				<p>
					The <a class="inline" href="">API</a> contains different allocation functions, 
					every allocation will be stored inside of a lookup table and free'd automagically
					on program termination. Optionally: The table can be drawn to the commandline at
					program exit.

			<h3>Latest News</h3>
			<h2>2005-06-16 11:55</h2>
			<p>
				After a long time and lots of lines of code i decided to skip my own XML-parser and 
				use the one braught with the libxml. It's easier interface and handling allows a 
				better error handling and a clean code.
				Meanwhile a lot of things in the API have been changed or are in progress.
